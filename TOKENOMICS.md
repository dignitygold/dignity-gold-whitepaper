Tokenomics Overview

Total Supply

The maximum and total supply of DIGau is fixed at 3,000,000,000 tokens. No additional tokens beyond this cap are planned. Of the total supply, 2,946,000,000 tokens have been minted. The remaining 54,000,000 tokens are reserved for controlled future issuance.

Token Allocation

The allocation of DIGau reflects historical continuity, long-term stewardship, and future ecosystem requirements.

600,000,000 tokens are allocated to founders, representing long-term alignment with the project and its execution.

400,000,000 tokens are allocated to insiders, early participants, and strategic stakeholders involved in the project’s restructuring and development.

1,300,000,000 tokens are allocated to legacy holders from prior token contracts. These tokens are restricted, non-transferable, and excluded from open market trading. They may only be acquired through company-initiated buybacks and are not intended to enter public circulation.

646,000,000 tokens are allocated to monetization and ecosystem programs, including incentives, partnerships, and long-term growth initiatives. These tokens are currently locked and subject to internal release controls.

54,000,000 tokens remain unminted and reserved for future issuance under controlled conditions.

Supply Schedule

Of the 54,000,000 unminted tokens, 38,000,000 tokens have already been pledged to a regulatory-aligned tranche and are not considered available supply. The remaining 16,000,000 tokens are reserved for future strategic placements.

No inflationary issuance mechanism exists. Any future issuance will follow a measured and milestone-driven approach aligned with operational progress and value creation.

Funding Context

To date, the project has raised 25 million USD, consisting of founder capital and external investment.

The project anticipates a future strategic capital raise of up to 100 million USD, sourced exclusively from the remaining 16,000,000 unminted tokens. No further funding rounds are planned beyond this allocation under the current supply framework.
