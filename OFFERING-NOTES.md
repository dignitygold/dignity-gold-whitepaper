Offering and Structural Notes

This document is intended to provide general, high-level context regarding the structural considerations of the DIGau digital asset. It does not constitute an offer, solicitation, or recommendation, and should be read in conjunction with the project disclaimer.

DIGau is designed as a digital asset associated with real-world asset oriented activities, rather than as a financial instrument representing equity, debt, or ownership in any legal entity. The structure is intended to allow for participation in a broader ecosystem while maintaining separation from corporate ownership or control.

Any historical or future distribution of DIGau is subject to internal governance decisions, applicable contractual arrangements, and relevant legal and regulatory considerations. Certain token categories are restricted, locked, or excluded from open market trading, and not all tokens are intended to be freely transferable.

Where capital has been raised historically, or may be raised in the future, such activity is conducted separately from public documentation and pursuant to appropriate legal frameworks. Any future offerings, if conducted, would be made only through formal documentation and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

DIGau should not be interpreted as a promise of returns, profit participation, or appreciation in value. The project does not make representations regarding future token price, liquidity, or market performance.

Participation in digital asset ecosystems involves risk, including the potential loss of value. Prospective participants are responsible for conducting their own independent assessment and consulting professional advisors before making any decisions.

This document is provided solely for informational purposes and does not replace or supersede any legal documentation.
